This wiki page applies to the following files:
* teampermissions.yml
* chestpermissions.yml

Both files will list all the commands that come under that category.
This file is automatically generated and will include all BetterTeams commands (this will also auto-update when BetterTeams updates)

Each command will have a section that looks something like this: 
```YAML
command:
  enabled: true
  rank: ADMIN
```
`enabled` is used to toggle if the command will appear in-game. If enabled is set to false, the command will not exist on the server. 
`rank` is used to determine the minimum rank the player must have to run the command (some commands do not have rank available) 
Possible values for `rank`:
* OWNER
* ADMIN
* DEFAULT

A few commands give access to all users regardless of rank, but do not allow making changes. For example `/team description` allows all players in a team to view the description of the team, but only the configured rank can change the teams description.
