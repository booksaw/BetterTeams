This wiki page applies to the following files:

* teampermissions.yml
* chestpermissions.yml

Both files will list all the commands that come under that category.
This file is automatically generated and will include all BetterTeams commands (this will also auto-update when
BetterTeams updates)

Each command will have a section that looks something like this:

```YAML
command:
  enabled: true
  rank: ADMIN
```

`enabled` is used to toggle if the command will appear in-game. If enabled is set to false, the command will not exist
on the server.
`rank` is used to determine the minimum rank the player must have to run the command (some commands do not have rank
available)
Possible values for `rank`:

* OWNER
* ADMIN
* DEFAULT

A few commands give access to all users regardless of rank, but do not allow making changes. For example
`/team description` allows all players in a team to view the description of the team, but only the configured rank can
change the teams description.
