# Select the default language of betterteams
# If you select a language which is not english remember they are translations done by the community, 
# This means they may lag behind the english version or have slight inaccuracies, but it will still be better than nothing
#
# Able to help with translations? Either improving a already existing language, or adding a whole new one. Join the discord server: https://discord.gg/JF9DNs3

# Determines how team data is stored
# Possible values: 
# * SQL - this is the recommended storage method, ensure you configure the database settings below else the plugin will be enabled
# * YAML - this is the default storage method as it does not require database connection, it is recommended to move to MySQL
# More storage types to come in the future 
storageType: YAML

# This section is only used if you select the storageType of SQL 
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: spigot
  user: root
  password: password
  # Prefix for SQL tables.
  # After changing this String and reloading the plugin/server,
  # BetterTeams will start using it as the new Table Prefix when storing and reading team data.
  # Only recommended changing when setting up your server,
  # otherwise all team data stored under the last prefix will stop being used until you change it back (if previous tables remain intact).
  # Thought for network servers that use the same database but are not supposed to share same team data.
  # Default value is "BetterTeams_" as it has always been, to prevent sudden change if you have been using SQL.
  tablePrefix: BetterTeams_

# This is the value to determine if the chat prefix is enabled
# - If this is enabled (true / name) a prefix [TeamName] will be displayed at the begining of chat messages.
# - If the player is not in a team, nothing will be displayed
# - This is the chat prefix for when players speak, this will not disable the prefix before messages generated by the plugin (see prefixFormat [below] to change that)
# - If this is set to tag, it will display the team tag instead of the team name (in the absence of a team tag, it will display the team name)
#
# Possible values: [true, false, name, tag]
prefix: name

# Set the format for the prefix of all messages sent to the user
# - Any chat colors can be used, for a reference see: https://www.spigotmc.org/attachments/example2-png.188806/
# - Ensure your prefix is surrounded by single quotes --> '' <-- else there is a chance it will not work correctly 
# - It is recommended to leave a space after the prefix within the quotation marks, so it does not look like this [prefix]message but instead [prefix] message
# - To disable the prefix, set the value to be ''
#
# Possible values: [Any text, any chat colours using the reference '&']
prefixFormat: '&7[&6BetterTeams&7] '
